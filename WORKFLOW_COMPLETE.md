### 📚 Documentation
- `docs/MCP_TESTING_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete workflow documentation
- Updated `package.json` with MCP-specific scripts

## 🎭 How the Workflow Works

### 1. **Preview per PR** ✅
```yaml
deploy-preview:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
      id: deploy
      run: |
        PREVIEW_URL=$(vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }})
        echo "preview-url=$PREVIEW_URL" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 2. **MCP Interactive Testing** ✅
```bash
# Use Playwright MCP to explore and generate tests
npm run test:mcp

# In VS Code with Copilot:
# - Navigate to preview URL interactively
# - Test user flows with browser automation
# - Generate test cases based on real interactions
# - Update existing tests when UI changes
```

### 3. **Automated CI Testing** ✅
```yaml
e2e-tests:
  needs: deploy-preview
  steps:
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      env:
        PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL: ${{ needs.deploy-preview.outputs.preview-url }}
      run: npx playwright test
```

### 4. **Merge Gate Protection** ✅
```yaml
merge-gate:
  needs: [deploy-preview, e2e-tests, lighthouse-audit]
  steps:
    - name: Check all tests passed
      run: |
        if [[ "${{ needs.e2e-tests.result }}" != "success" ]]; then
          echo "❌ E2E tests failed - blocking merge"
          exit 1
        fi
```

## 🎪 Live Demonstration

We've successfully demonstrated the MCP workflow by:

1. **✅ Navigating to live LexiBot site** - https://lexi-botai.vercel.app
2. **✅ Testing upload page functionality** - File chooser opens correctly
3. **✅ Exploring chat interface** - Input fields and buttons work
4. **✅ Capturing page snapshots** - Complete accessibility tree analysis
5. **✅ Generating test cases** - Based on real browser interactions

## 🚀 Next Steps to Activate

### Required GitHub Secrets
Add these to your repository settings:
```bash
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_deployment_token
VERCEL_ORG_ID=your_vercel_organization_id
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=your_vercel_project_id
GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_pat
```

### Activate MCP in VS Code
1. Install the MCP extension for VS Code
2. Add your GitHub token to `.vscode/mcp.json`
3. Restart VS Code to load MCP servers

### Test the Complete Flow
```bash
# 1. Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-mcp-workflow.sh

# 2. Use MCP for interactive testing
npm run test:mcp

# 3. Create a PR to see the full workflow
git checkout -b feature/test-mcp-workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Add MCP testing workflow"
git push origin feature/test-mcp-workflow
```
